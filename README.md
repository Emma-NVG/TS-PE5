**Task1: Intrusion Detection**

Note: Please download the Intrusion detection evaluation dataset (ISCX IDS 2012) from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids.html.

First, please use any ML or DL algorithms to finish the Intrusion detection task, including malicious and normal classification, analysis of different metrics, and particular attention to false alert rate.

**Task 2: Binary Search Tree**

Please create a binary search tree and node classes as I have shown in the lecture, including search, insert, delete, and traverse functions, using the following three lists to create the tree and combine the above-created function. each step please give output or changed tree plot.

a = [49, 38, 65, 97, 60, 76, 13, 27, 5, 1]

b = [149, 38, 65, 197, 60, 176, 13, 217, 5, 11]

c = [49, 38, 65, 97, 64, 76, 13, 77, 5, 1, 55, 50, 24]

**Task 3: SDN Traffic classification with DT**

Please use the second practical exercise  SDN traffic CSV file as your dataset and make traffic category classification with decision tree classifiers obtain classification metrics, and compare ID3 and CART are two algorithms' performance differences.
